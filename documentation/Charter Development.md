## 1. Specifique Objectif

The site will be designed for people who want to track their reading progress of manhwa and manhua, as well as discover new works.

The main objectives are:

* **Display information about manhwa and manhua** to all visitors.
* **Allow users to track their reading progress** by adding manhwa and manhua to their library, updating the number of chapters read/remaining, and leaving personal notes.
* **Allow users to create a manhwa and manhua entry**, with certain mandatory information displayed. These entries are private by default but can be made public after review by an admin.
* *(Beyond the MVP)* **Enable users to share their appreciation and feedback** on the manhwa and manhua they read.


## 2. Stakeholders and Roles

## 3. Project Scope

### In-Scope

* Users can add a manhwa and manhua to their personal library to keep track of progress (e.g., number of chapters released and number of chapters read).
* Users can view detailed information about manhwa and manhua, including description, release date, author(s), and status.
* Users can rate manhwa and manhua. (Commenting is planned but not part of the MVP.)
* Users can add existing manhwa and manhua that are not yet listed on the platform, either as private entries or public submissions (public submissions must be verified by an admin).

### Out-of-Scope

* Reading manhwa and manhua directly within the platform.
* Allowing users to become authors and publish their own manhwa and manhua (to be considered only once reading is possible).
* Allowing users to act as translators and provide translations into other languages (to be considered only once reading is possible).
* Advanced monetization features such as purchasing individual manhwa and manhua or subscribing to unlock access.
* Social features such as chat or discussion threads linked to each manhwa and manhua.
